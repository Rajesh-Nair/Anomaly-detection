## Anomaly detection (Fraud) on Credit card transactions



Work in progress....

In this project we will work on anomaly detection on credit card transactions using the available dataset on Kaggle. These anomlaies or outliers are potential Fraud and such problems differs from ordinary supervised learning since the volume of outliers in the dataset would be very few. Traditional supervised learning model often fail to pick outliers and hence such problems needs to be dealt differently.

1) Statistical method - using t-test and Gaussian distribution
2) Machine Learning method - Using supervised learning (Random Forest) and Unsupervised Learning (Isolation Forest)
3) Deep Learning method - Using Autoencoder......
